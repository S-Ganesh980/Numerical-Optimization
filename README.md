Constraint Optimization of a Cryptarithmetic puzzle  

Constraint optimization is a technique of identifying feasible solutions out of a large set of variables where the problem is modelled in terms of arbitrary constraints. 

A classic example of constraint optimization is Cryptarithmetic Puzzle which is a mathematical exercise where the digits of some numbers are represented by letters or symbols. Each letter or symbol represents a unique digit. The goal is to find the digits such that a given mathematical equation is verified. Here we use CP-SAT solver to solve cryptarithmetic problems.
